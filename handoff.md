# Recent Work Summary
- Added `AGENTS.md` containing repository guidelines: project layout, build/run commands, coding style, testing guidance, commit/PR practices, and security tips for the SwiftUI + Firebase app.
- Added production-quality documentation and inline comments across all Swift files to explain responsibilities, side effects, and async boundaries.

# Recent Prompts
- User requested a concise contributor guide titled "Repository Guidelines" following an outline (structure, commands, style, testing, commits/PRs, security).
- User reminded to follow top-level working principles (work doggedly, add logging when debugging, validate work, avoid long-running commands) and to update this `handoff.md` after work.
- User asked for production-quality comments across the Swift/SwiftUI codebase using doc comments and meaningful inline notes without altering functionality.
